# Specify a scope of objects we can create:
# v1: componentStatus, configMap, Endpoints, Event, Namespace, Pod etc.
# apps/v1: ControllerRevision, StatefulSet
apiVersion: v1
# There are several types of created objects: StatefulSet, ReplicaController, Pod - running one container or more, Service - setting up networking, Deployment - maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number exists.
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: client-node-port
spec:
  # Service has 4 sub-types: ClusterIP (Exposes a set of pods to other objects in the cluster), NodePort (Exposes a container to the outside world), LoadBalancer and Ingress
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    # Other pod, that needs access to the current one can access via this port
    - port: 3050
    # We want to send any incoming trafic into port 3000 inside this pod. And the port 3000 is mapped to the multi-client container in the client-pod.yaml.
      targetPort: 3000
    # Port to access the pod from any browser (30000-32767)
      nodePort: 31515
  # That's how client-pod is linked to the client-node-port. The key/value can be anything: key: value
